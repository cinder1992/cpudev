4bitmicro, a logisim-evolution experiment

4bitmicro.circ is the logisim-evolution file that contains the CPU, the hardware is set up to have a TTY at address 0xFFE

Mostly undocumented, instruction set detailed in the 4bitmicro.txt file
example compiled program listed in 4bitmicro_ttyout.bin, still can't find the source.
4bitmicro.code contains the uncompiled microcode, 4bitmicro.txt contains the microcode instructions and the decoder ROM implementation.
